Your review should:
1. Indicate whether the previous solution needs adjustment
2. When adjustment is NEEDED, provide a new complete Python function that executes the program with the correct concrete values SATISFYING the constraints.

The Python function must:
- Use the signature `execute_program(timeout: int) -> tuple[str, int]`, which takes a timeout to execute the program and returns its [stderr, return_code] (even after the timeout):
  - stderr: The standard error output of the program under test
  - return_code: The return code of the program under test
- Use the concrete values you've generated that satisfy all constraints to execute the program
- Include all necessary imports and setup and handle all required environment setup and cleanup
- Follow the same basic structure as the original execution, but with your solution values
- Handle execution failures appropriately: raise exceptions for any execution issues.
