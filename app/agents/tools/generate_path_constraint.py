_GENERATE_PATH_CONSTRAINT_DESCRIPTION = """Use this tool to generate the symbolic constraints required to reach the CURRENTLY selected target branch.

Your constraints should:
1. Focus on program inputs and environment conditions 
    - Specify what values or conditions must be true for inputs
    - Avoid intermediate program states or internal variables
2. Be expressed clearly - Use natural language, code snippets, SMT formulas, or a combination as appropriate
3. Follow chronological execution order - Present constraints in the sequence they would be encountered during execution
4. Be complete - Cover all conditions that must be satisfied to reach the target branch
5. Be CONCISE - AVOID unnecessary complexity and AVOID providing concrete examples or test cases
6. Be SELF-CONTAINED - The constraints will be read by someone who has NEVER SEEN THE SOURCE CODE
    - DO NOT reference internal functions or variables without explanation
    - EXPLICITLY describe file format requirements (exact byte positions, values, meanings), especially for uncommonly used formats
    - Avoid jargon or function names without providing context about what they validate

Some common constraints:
- Input file format requirements (structure, headers, fields)
- Specific values or ranges for command-line arguments
- Environmental conditions (file existence, permissions, environment variables)
- Mathematical relationships between input values
- String properties (length, content, encoding)
- Relationships between multiple inputs

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on symbolic analysis rather than concrete execution. Hence, DO NOT provide concrete examples or test cases.
- DO NOT attempt to solve the constraints or suggest inputs that would satisfy them
- Your role is ONLY to identify and state the constraints clearly enough that someone without code access can understand them
- Constraint solving will be handled by a separate tool in a later step

The constraints you generate will be used by other tools to create test cases that explore the target branch.
