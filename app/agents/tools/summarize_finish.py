Use this tool when:
- You have sufficiently explored multiple target branches and generated their path constraints
- You cannot find additional valuable branches to explore based on the current information
- You think the current target branches provide adequate coverage

The task_completed field should be set to True to indicate you've successfully completed the exploration process and are ready to stop.
